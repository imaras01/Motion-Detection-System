# Motion-Detection-System
The project for my final thesis presents a successful implementation of a motion detection system using Raspberry Pi and the Video4Linux2 (V4L2) API. A comprehensive solution was developed that encompasses camera initialization and efficient buffer management.


A functional motion detection system was implemented, based on comparing consecutive video frames, with an adjustable threshold for identifying significant movements, providing the user with flexibility to define what constitutes suspicious motion.


Additionally, an email notification system was implemented, which activates when the system detects movement outside the allowed range. The libcurl library was used for the implementation of the email notification system.
